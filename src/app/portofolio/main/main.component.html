<p>Most of my projects are programming related, but I split them into the games I developed, and other programming projects.</p>

<p>Note that this website is also developed by me with Angular. Another project I would mention is starting a company, but I put it on hold while studying for the masterâ€™s degree because I am also working on another start-up.</p>
