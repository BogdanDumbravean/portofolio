        <p>Most of my projects are programming related, but I split them into the games I developed (most of which were realised in Unity) and other programming projects. While I present here even some small projects, this list does not include everything, for various reasons.</p>
        <p>Note that this website is also developed by me with Angular. Another project I would mention is that I started a company, but I put it on hold while studying for the masterâ€™s degree and working on another start-up.</p>
